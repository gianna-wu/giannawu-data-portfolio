## 🌐 Part 1 — Multi-Page Website
A clean, fully hand-coded website built with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript.  
The site includes:
- A welcome/splash page  
- An About Me page  
- A resource page introducing implicit bias  
- A “Tech Hero” profile page  
- A unified global stylesheet and consistent navigation

Focus areas: **information structure, readability, accessibility, and simple front-end design.**

## 🤖 Part 2 — Teachable Machine Integration
The website was extended by adding a new page featuring a custom machine learning model.

Includes:
- A Teachable Machine (image/audio) classifier  
- Real-time in-browser predictions via TensorFlow.js  
- A project statement reflecting on data, bias, and model limitations  
- Embedded demo video / live model interaction

This demonstrates basic ML workflow understanding and the ability to integrate ML models into web environments.
